<h1>Credit limit Prediction</h1>

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedasimalishah/credit-card-limit-prediction/data

<h2>Observations from initial data analysis</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Student: 85% of the data is marked as not a student while out of the remaining 15%, the ages are in between 40 and 80. So it is not practical to use this data as 40+ are generally not students.</li>
  <li>Ethnicity: Dropping Ethnicity as the data contains just 3 ethnicities and no clear pattern between them either.</li>
  <li>Income: There is a clear correlation between Income and limit.</li>
  <li>Age: There is a recurring pattern between Age and Limit.</li>
  <li>Cards: There is a slight pattern between cards and Limit which might be more clear if there is more data available.</li>
  <li>Education: Similar pattern to age bins</li>
  <li>Married: Married people have slightly higher limit than unmarried</li>
  <li>Gender: Females have slightly higher limit</li>
</ol>
