# Credit Limit Prediction Repository

This repository is dedicated to our credit limit prediction models and algorithms.

You can read and learn about related report with primary and secondary research about the BNPL industry in Uzbekistan [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c5u_VMlW8WvlbIM9NAgjzpHo6rCcVXOi/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107772990378977160799&rtpof=true&sd=true).

Dataset used: [Credit Card Limit Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedasimalishah/credit-card-limit-prediction/data)

## Observations from initial data analysis
1. Student: 85% of the data is marked as not a student while out of the remaining 15%, the ages are in between 40 and 80. So it is not practical to use this data as 40+ are generally not students.
2. Ethnicity: Dropping Ethnicity as the data contains just 3 ethnicities and no clear pattern between them either.
3. Income: There is a clear correlation between Income and limit.
4. Age: There is a recurring pattern between Age and Limit.
5. Cards: There is a slight pattern between cards and Limit which might be more clear if there is more data available.
6. Education: Similar pattern to age bins.
7. Married: Married people have slightly higher limit than unmarried.
8. Gender: Females have slightly higher limit.

## API endpoints on Render
1. You can view and manage your endpoints on [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/) (Log in with GitHub).
2. The endpoint for this repo is [https://credit-limit-prediction.onrender.com](https://credit-limit-prediction.onrender.com), and you can view available APIs with [Swagger UI](https://credit-limit-prediction.onrender.com/docs#).
3. Import the following `curl` commands to check the predictions:
   - For linear regression:
     ```bash
     curl --location --request GET 'https://credit-limit-prediction.onrender.com/predict/linear_regression' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'income: 20000' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
         "income": "20000"
     }'
     ```
   - For XGBoost predictions:
     ```bash
     curl --location --request GET 'https://credit-limit-prediction.onrender.com/predict/xgboost_regression' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
         "Income": 155000,
         "Age": 40,
         "Gender": "Female",
         "Married": "No",
         "Cards": 3,
         "Education": 11
     }'
     ```
4. The free tier of render spins down on inactivity. So if you feel the API is slow, give it a couple of minutes for the first 2 calls. It will work fast after that. (Or setup a cron job on some free website)
